In order to simulate the depletion of channels and in order to determine and compare the difference between the two algorithms and how they will differ,

1. We can do two things either consider any p% percentage of edges using random sampling and deplete them in one direction.
2. Second is to consider node centrality and focus transactions on central nodes more and hence they get depleated more frequently.
3. Thirs is to consider channel capacity to distribute depletion probability.
